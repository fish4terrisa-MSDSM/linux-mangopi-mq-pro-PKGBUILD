# PKGBUILD for Linux kernel on MangoPi MQ-Pro

This is a PKGBUILD that allowed you to build a linux kernel for MangoPi MQ-Pro on ArchLinux riscv port.

Modified from [sehraf/d1-riscv-arch-image-builder](https://github.com/sehraf/d1-riscv-arch-image-builder), just followed the instructions to build a kernel in `1_compile.sh` in that repo.

This PKGBUILD is aimed to make it easier to let `pacman` handle the DKMS and other stuffs.
